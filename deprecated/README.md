# Django-based SDNdbg

This contains a snapshot of the SDNdbg project that
is Django-based.  In November 2016, I decided it may be
best to first get functionality (perhaps even update capabilities)
before doing any persistence.

Probably might be better to use a nosql database that can do graphs
and also look at perhaps time-series databases if we want to be able
to pull metrics down to help in debugging of SDN issues.

In other words, keeping up with Django changes and working around
it was distracting me from the complexities needed to properly get
any significant progress done.
