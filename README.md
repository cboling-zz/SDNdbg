# Visualization.

Need something to display nodes and links.  A node can contain internal nodes and links as well.

Possible JS libraries include:
* http://www.draw2d.org/
* http://js.cytoscape.org/
* TODO: More here

For cytoscape.js, there is also Cytoscape Desktop at http://www.cytoscape.org.  May be more easy to use this first
rather than a JS page inside jango.  Just need to figure out the proper JSON format for what we want to do.
